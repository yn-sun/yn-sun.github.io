Research Interest
======
My research interest focus on theory and applications of automated machine learning, including:
* explainable/interpretable neural architecture search (NAS)
* convergence analysis for evolutionary computation-based NAS
* multi-/many-objective/ and constrained optimization for NAS
* low-energy consumption NAS with high-inference speed
* feature selection and construction
* auto data augmentation
